      description: "Ideally, the name focuses on the weakness/mistake - not the attack. Minimize use of ambiguous words to keep the name short.\n
                    Where feasible, use terminology as defined in the CWE glossary and/or vulnerability theory documents. The name should include:\n 
                    1. the intended behavior of the code\n 
                    2. the mistake (i.e. weakness)\n
                    3. the affected resource (if relevant)\n
                    4. the affected technology (if relevant). Use of CWE-specific vocabulary is preferred but not required.\n"
